# Java Searching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various searching algorithms in Java.



## Algorithms Implemented

The following searching algorithms are implemented in this repository:

1. **Linear Search**  
   A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
   
2. **Binary Search**  
   A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the target value with the middle element of the array.

3. **Insertion Sort**
       Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that iteratively picks elements from an unsorted portion of an array and inserts them into their correct position in the sorted portion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of Java programming.

### Installation
To use these algorithms in your project, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-searching-algorithms.git
